# Kobo

The first operating system where AI agents and humans co-manage a company — visualized through an intuitive spatial interface that turns work management into world-building.

## Vision

A world where one founder can operate with the execution power of a full team — and where every company, regardless of size, has access to a tireless, intelligent organizational layer that never loses context, never drops a task, and gets smarter every day it runs.

## Mission

To build the first Autonomous Company OS — a workspace where AI agents and humans share real accountability for work, with deliberative intelligence, institutional memory, and measurable execution quality at the core.
